# USPS_occupancy_regression
Personal project on a full end to end ML pipeline using some real-world USPS data
scrape_beautifulsoup was used for scraping data from USPS and feeding said information into a structured folder. 
Afterwards webscraping_cleanup.ipynb was used for regression training (view the jupyter notebook!)
